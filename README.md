Implementation


•	Login 
The user must login into the system using a validated password. For the purpose of this program the password will be: clyderunners.

As this code is being supplied by another developer you must first unit test it to ensure that it works before integrating it with the rest of the program as part of the integration testing. (the source code for login will be supplied to you by your assessor).



•	Menu
The user will be presented with the following menu:
1.	Read and Display File (the file will be the text file supplied to you by Glasgow Clyde Runners and will include the runner’s names and times for the 400m finalists) The data in the file should be stored using a 2D array and printed back to the user. 
2.	Sort and Print Recorded Times
Using a simple sort algorithm, you must sort the recorded times from slowest to fastest and output the result to anther text file using a suitable name etc. you should also output the result to the user.
3.	Find and Print Fastest Time
Using the min algorithm, you must find the fastest recorded time and output the result to another file using a suitable name etc. you should also output the result to the user.
4.	Find and Print the Slowest Time
Using the max algorithm, you must find the slowest recorded time and output the result to another file using a suitable name etc. you should also output the result to the user.
5.	Search 
Ask the user to enter a time (seconds) and using a linear search algorithm see if this time has been recorded for the 400m race. You must ouput the result to another file using a suitable name etc. you should also output the result to the user.
6.	Time Occurrence
Ask the user to enter a time (seconds) and using the occurences algorithm see how many times this time has been recorded for the 400m race and output the result to another file using a suitable name etc. You should also output the result to the user.
7.	Exit Program
The program should exit, and the user should be given a suitable message.
